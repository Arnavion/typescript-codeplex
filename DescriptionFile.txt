Renaming TokenIDs to no longer contain abbreviations.
    
Note: many of the names were chosen based on the conventions of the Roslyn project.
Keeping entities that mean the same thing in sync between the two projects seems
reasonable as long as it is simple to do so.

Some specific principles for tokens:
1) As tokens may appear in multiple constructs, we do not embue them with semantic
   meaning.  i.e. "?" is not "TernaryOperator" it is "Question" (as it can appear
   in a ternary or in an optional property description
2) Names are chosen based on their common ascii naming usage.  So we use 'Exclamation'
   for "!" rather than "Bang" (or "Not" which would be semantic).

This does lead to verbosity.  But it also makes token ids completely self descriptive.

Note: There are additional changes we could make as well.  For example, adding a "Keyword"
suffix as appropriate (to help disambiguate 'String' from 'StringLiteral').  However,
this seemed less important, so i have held off from that for now.
